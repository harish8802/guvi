Problem Statement:

Create a signup page where a user can register, a login page to log in with the necessary details needed during registration.

Successful login should redirect to a profile page which should contain additional details such as age, dob, contact, etc. The user can update,

Flow: Register> Login > Profile

Points to remember:

1.HTML, JS, CSS, and PHP code should be in separate files, none of the codes must co-exist in the same file. 
2. Only use Jquery AJAX for interacting with the backend (strictly no usage of form submission). 
3. CSS can be used but the form must be designed in bootstrap in order to maintain page responsiveness.
4. Use MySql for storing the registered data and MongoDB for Storing the details of the user profiles In MySQL always use Prepared Statements, with no usage of simple SQL
statements. The login session should be maintained only using browser localstorage
(Do not use PHP Session)
5. Use Redis to store the session information in the backend.
6.Either host it in Netlify or share us your GITHUB project link.
